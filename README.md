1. **![Yellow Star](https://via.placeholder.com/10/FFFF00?text=+) Hole Information**  
     
   All relevant information for the current hole is displayed here, including the hole number, par, yardage, and shot number.

2. **![White Star](https://via.placeholder.com/10/FFFFFF?text=+) Shot Categorization**  
     
   After taking your shot, you can categorize it as either:
   - **Great**
   - **Good**
   - **Bad**
   - **Putt**

   These categories are subjective and based on how you felt about the shot, considering factors like contact, outcome, or stress level.

3. **![Pink Star](https://via.placeholder.com/10/FFC0CB?text=+)  Fairway in Regulation (FIR) and Green in Regulation (GIR) Tracking**  
    
   - If your **tee shot** lands in the fairway, check off the **FIR** box.
   - If your **approach shot** lands on the green, allowing two putts to make par, check the **GIR** box.  
     For a GIR, your ball should be on the green:
     - **Par 3:** First shot
     - **Par 4:** Second shot
     - **Par 5:** Third shot

4. **![Blue Star](https://via.placeholder.com/10/00BFFF?text=+)  Next Hole Button**  
    
   Tap the **Next** button in the top right corner to advance to the next hole.  
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Once you proceed to the next hole, you cannot go back and change your score. Make sure it's correct before moving on.
